# Scrapes
A bunch of random small projects that I don't want to bother to put as a separate Git repository.
- `py-simplang`
  - A very basic toy programming language that I've been working on periodically.
- `py-animated-ascii`
  - A cool animation of an ASCII art I found online. I found it [here](https://www.asciiart.eu/space/other).
- `py-concat-md-files`
  - Recursively traverse filesystem tree, find the markdown files there,
    concatenate them into one markdown file, then print the concatenation.
